The purpose of this project is to download wiki entries (specifically wikivoyage/wikitravel pages) and store them on disk. Since I find myself without internet access a lot (on the road/abroad) this is particularly useful for myself if I want to read up on something without internet access. (obviously the point is to download these pages first)

- this is not yet finished, only the crawler works at this point

dependencies:

golang
goquery (https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery) - which is awesome by the way
 - $ go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery
